'''
Approach 1 - BINARY SEARCH O(log(min(n, m)))

perform BS to find the correct partition in array1,
according to it only, partition in array2 is determined


Approach 2 â€“ Divide & conquer O(log(m+n))

Also, we can use algo of find kth element in 2 sorted arrays.
We divide both arr in 2 parts each.

-If k lies in 1st part of merged sorted arr,
 eliminate second half of any one arraybased on their medians.
-else k lies in second half,
 so eliminate first half of any one array based on their medians.
